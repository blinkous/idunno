This is a repository testing out Android Studio app development and pushing those projects to github. 
In it, you'll find a few buttons on the main activity that lead to different screens, some of which are there for fun.
Some of the buttons will lead you to activities where you can draw.

This gif demos the Paint Activity featured in the app.
